## Introduction

This library was raised by Chiron to avenge the crimes against JSON and its
heirs in the Erlang world. It is destined to search for Golden Parse, as
revealed by the Cloud Goddess.


## Installation

Just add it to your ``rebar.config`` deps:

```erlang
  {deps, [
    ...
    {ljson, ".*",
      {git, "git@github.com:thorgisl/ljson.git", "master"}}
      ]}.
```

And then do the usual:

```bash
    $ rebar get-deps
    $ rebar compile
```


## Usage

TBD.
